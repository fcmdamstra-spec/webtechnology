                    "We’re providing a good quality of life,” Boyle said. 
                    "We have good light, good amenities and, most importantly, lots of space.” 
                    In New York City, a town famous for teacup-sized apartments, this is no small draw.
                    Already, interest in the building is buzzing. 
                    One loft is rented. 
                    And, judging by response during a tour, other renters should flock.
                    Ten years ago, this would have been unheard of. 
                    The last several decades have been unkind to Crown Heights. 
                    Race riots, drug dealing, and abandoned buildings were common sights.
                    Storefronts went vacant, and the neighborhood’s reputation for danger was well founded. 
                    Hence, the project’s enthusiastic embrace by the surrounding community.
                    Local auto body workers and neighbors have followed the project closely, Boyle says. 
                    They constantly inquire about updates, and Boyle and Brown appease curiosity with tours. 
                    "The [neighborhood] has been very accepting and supportive,” Boyle says.
                    In the words of Letitia James, New York City Council representative, "These people are at the forefront of revitalizing Crown Heights.”
                    They are also realizing New York City’s first green-certified residential building— they hope. 
                    The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification process is arduous. 
                    LEEDs a voluntary, consensus-based national standard for developing

                <td>
                    high-performance, sustainable buildings. 
                    Its guidelines are stiff. 
                    To receive certification, a building must accrue a set number of environmental "points.” Storm-water management, proximity to mass transportation, and creating renewable energy, for example, net points. 
                    A comprehensive application (including photos, construction documentation, floor plans, LEED checklists, etc.) is submitted to LEED, which reviews the request.
                    "It’s going to take us months to sift through the paperwork,” Boyle says. 
                    The payoff will be worth it, however— green certification means new grants.
                    Grants are not the only awards Susan and Benton have received either. 
                    On April 7 ribbon- cutting at the Icehouse Lofts, Borough President Markowitz unfurled an unusual proclamation: 
                    "Today,” he said, "I decree to be Susan Boyle and Benton Brown Day . . . Together, we can paint this town green.”
                    The couple accepted their awards with sheepish smiles of people not accustomed to the spotlight. 
                    For two years they’ve toiled countless seven-day weeks. Work has been hard, and it’s not over yet.
                    When the couple bought the icehouse, they also received the brewery itself— another daunting brick structure in disrepair. 
                    The building, bearing faded ads for Heinz Ketchup, is connected via the backyard — and underground brick tunnels — to the icehouse. 
                    The structure sits idle, but it has potential. 
                    Boyle and Brown have dreamed up a few ideas, but for now their plan is simple:
                    'We’re going to take a well deserved break,” Boyle said.
