        <h3>Which parts of the page were easy to create?</h3>
        <p>Fitting the texts in the tables to make sure the lay-out was the same as the page was a bit tedious because of the copy pasting and 
            because I wanted to make sure the text was still easily readable in the code, but it was not difficult to do.
        </p>

        <h3>Which parts were challenging?</h3>
        <p>Making sure the right words were bold and the right ones were not because I had to be very thorough with this.</p>

        <h3>Which parts were not possible?</h3>
        <p>Getting the picture to fill the entire width of the screen. 
            When I tried to do this, the image got really grainy and unclear so I decided to keep the image the size it was in the original text.
            In addition to this, I wanted to make the background color an off-white color by using a 'style' attribute inside the body tag, 
            but when I looked into this more this was CSS and not HTML so this was also not possible.
